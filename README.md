# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to help new students in coding bootcamps easily have all of the information they are learning in one convenient place. I built this project because as a new student myself, I found it overwhelming to try to retain all of the information coming my way and wanted an organised way to recall everything. In creating this webpage, I have everything that I have learnt so far in one place but in neat sections, making it easy to refer back to things and study as I continue in the bootcamp, as well as adding more as I learn it. During the process, I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and debugging.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to refer to information about the topics HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript in separate sections. If you open the DevTools console while on the webpage, you can see the JavaScript running, which will list the topics learned during prework and randomly pick one to study.
